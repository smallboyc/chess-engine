## ♟️ Chess! – A Chess Game Developed in C++ / OpenGL

A solo project developed during my 4th semester in engineering school, this chess game was fully coded from scratch — and all 3D assets were created by me as well.

It’s my very first project using **Modern OpenGL**, with a strong focus on **clean code** and well-structured architecture.

**🛠️ Technologies used:**

C++ · Modern OpenGL · ImGui (for UI)

- Developed a small personal library called **glmax**, allowing:
    - Parsing of `.obj` files with textures and materials (via *tinyobjloader*)
    - Generation of OpenGL-compatible 3D meshes
- 🧊 **All models** (chess pieces and board) were **hand-modeled in Blender**

---

### 🚀 Main Features:

- **All official chess rules** have been implemented:
    
    Check, checkmate, castling, stalemate, etc. *(these were not required for the project, but I added them to create a complete experience)*
    
- **Smooth 3D piece animations**, with adjustable transitions
- The interface was first designed in **2D**, inspired by platforms like Chess.com,
    
    then extended with a **3D renderer** that mirrors 2D actions
